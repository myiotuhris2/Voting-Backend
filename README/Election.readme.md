1. **Installing Node.js, npm and Git**

Starting in this section, we will begin to build and run projects in a local development environment. Please make sure you have installed the LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.js:

<https://nodejs.org/en/download/>

![](Aspose.Words.5859fe6b-2042-4c2b-ab82-3442b1c17acf.001.png)

We do not recommend installing the Current release as this often will include bugs or breaking changes that many libraries may not have fully resolved.

When you install Node.js it will automatically install **npm** which is a CLI tool that we will use frequently throughout the course.

**Installing Git**

You will also need to have Git installed on your system.

**Windows Users:**

Install Git For Windows using the link below. This will also install the GitBash terminal which is helpful as it will allow you to type the same commands as shown in the lecture videos. GitBash would replace the use of the CommandPrompt or Powershell.

**Environment Setup**

Due to expected dependency conflicts with old installed versions, it would be best to create a brand-new project.

In your terminal of choice, run the following:

1. mkdir Election
2. cd Election
3. npm init -y
4. npm install solc@0.8.9 web3 mocha ganache @truffle/hdwallet-provider


**2. Updated Metamask Setup for new UI**

This note will provide instructions for setting up Metamask with its new UI.

1. First, install the extension for your specific browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended)

**3. Obtaining More Test Ether from Recommended Faucet**

Since we will be using the Sepolia Network, we will need to use a Sepolia faucet to obtain test ether. All current faucets require some level of authentication to protect against DOS attacks and bots.

**Option #1 Alchemy Sepolia Faucet**

**To avoid complications in onboarding, we generally recommend the following best practices:**

\- Use your actual first name and last name.

\- Avoid spammy domains in your email address. We recommend using @gmail.com, @outlook.com, @imessage.com, etc. — even your own domain if it’s legitimate.

\- If account creation using an email and password doesn’t work, try using “Sign in with Google” and connecting to your Google account.

\- Try another email address if your original one isn’t working.

\- Try from a new browser and new network.

1. Visit <https://sepoliafaucet.com/>
2. Register for a free Alchemy account (we recommend using “Sign in with Google” to avoid issues)
3. You should automatically be taken into an onboarding flow. If not you can find the Complete Onboarding button at the top right-hand of your screen:

   ![](Aspose.Words.5859fe6b-2042-4c2b-ab82-3442b1c17acf.011.png)

4. You will be prompted to create a team. You may enter any value you wish.
5. The next prompt will be the type of project you are building. We are just requesting ether, so, you can put anything you'd like here.
6. At the Let's choose your chain prompt, select **Ethereum** and click **Next**.
7. Select the **Free** plan
8. At the credit card payment form, click **Skip for now**.

10. You will be redirected back to the Sepolia faucet landing page.
11. Go to the Metamask extension in your browser and make sure you are signed in and the **Sepolia Test Network** is selected. Then, copy the account address that is listed:
